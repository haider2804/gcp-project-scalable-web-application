# GCP Project: Scalable Web Application with Serverless Architecture

## Overview
This project involves developing a scalable web application using serverless technologies on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## What It Covers
### Frontend
- Build a dynamic frontend using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a framework like React or Vue.js.
- Host the frontend on Cloud Storage.

### Backend
- Create a REST API using Cloud Functions with Python.
- Use Firebase Authentication for user management.

### Database
- Store user data in Firestore.

### Deployment
- Use Cloud Build for CI/CD.

### Monitoring
- Set up Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging.

## Languages Used
- JavaScript (frontend)
- Python (backend)

## Project 2: Real-Time Data Processing and Analytics
### Overview
Build a real-time data processing and analytics system that utilizes the web application from Project 1.

### What It Covers
#### Data Ingestion
- Use Pub/Sub to ingest real-time data from the web application (e.g., user interactions).

#### Data Processing
- Create data processing pipelines using Dataflow with Python.

#### Storage
- Store processed data in BigQuery.

#### Visualization
- Build a dashboard using Data Studio or Google Charts to visualize analytics.

#### Automation
- Schedule data processing jobs using Cloud Scheduler.

### Dependencies
- Utilizes the web application and Firestore from Project 1.

## Languages Used
- Python (data processing)
- JavaScript (for visualization)

## Project 3: Machine Learning Model Deployment and API Integration
### Overview
Develop and deploy a machine learning model that analyzes data from the previous projects and provides predictions or insights.

### What It Covers
#### Data Preparation
- Use data stored in BigQuery for training your model (from Project 2).

#### Model Training
- Train a model using AI Platform with Python (e.g., TensorFlow or scikit-learn).

#### Model Deployment
- Deploy the trained model as a REST API using Cloud Functions or AI Platform Prediction.

#### Frontend Integration
- Update the web application to call the ML API and display predictions (JavaScript).

#### CI/CD
- Implement CI/CD for the model using Cloud Build.

#### Monitoring
- Monitor model performance and log predictions with Cloud Logging.

### Dependencies
- Builds on data analytics and user data from Projects 1 and 2.
